# January 2018-Georgios Balikas


On January 10th, 2018 Georgios Balikas gave a meet-up presentation entitled "Machine learning for predicting the sentiment of tweets".

The repository contains the slides of the talk ("SentimentBalikas.pdf") and a pointer to the github repository for the code used to obtain the scores reported in the presentation. For reference, the abstract and the a short bio of Georgios, below.

For the code, in the form of an Jupyter Notebook, and instructions on how to run it please visit:

## Talk Abstract

Sentiment classification is the task of predicting the sentiment polarity of a written text passage.
Being able to automatically analyze the sentiment conveyed by such text passages
is important for various applications, for instance when assessing consumer satisfaction. Microblogging platforms like Twitter are nowadays ubiquitous and enable users to express their sentiment
on different subjects. While they are a rich source of user-generated content,
there are major challengs in analyzing their content. For instance, tweets are
very short messages where punctuation and language are used in very creative ways.

In this talk, I will present a machine learning approach for predicting the sentiment of tweets. After introducing the task and the
difficulties it poses, I will describe the steps taken for building a state-of-the-art sentiment classifier for tweets.
I will conclude the talk with empirical evaluation of the proposed method and with a discussion on the challenges and limitations of sentiment analysis.
